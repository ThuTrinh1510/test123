# Translation Fields 

This module allows you to update values from newly created fields with specific languages into the translations of the same field and vice versa.

**Before** 

Users may want to view and edit the translations of a specific field in different languages on the same form view, without accessing a separate pop-up window for each language's translation.

**After**
 
This module introduces a checking rule for any newly created field. If the field exists, a translation action is created to allow for updating the translation value of that field. Additionally, the module initializes the newly created field with any available translation value.
